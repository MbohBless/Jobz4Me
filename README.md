# Jobz4Me
This is my Gads Project Submission
the project is based on the idea that as the days go by, those who promise to provide jobs tend to provide them but the availability of job information is one of the most technical 
difficulties on actually seeing or locating the jobs. platforms like whatapp provide such services but its not custom made for such operations. 
So with the platform i developped i called it Jobz4Me so basically it is a platform where you as an individual having an odd or a professional job could post and other
inerested individuals could then contact him/her provided they are not satisfies with the provides information. the applications makes use of google's Maps and Udemy's affiliate 
book api both api's play a very vital role in the operation of the said system. for the google map from the initial adoption, the precise location for the job can be put n the application 
so as to facilitate locating where he/she could get to the individual. In cases where an individual sees the job and is interted but cannot apply due to the lack of the required skills,
then there is the availability of the udemy courses which are available bases on the specific course or job category requirement. courses route the user to the udemy website which 
can then facilitate the purchasing of the couse. if there is a need to pay for it
